- 👋 G'day! I’m @TheDichotomist, but you can call me Nickolai! (or Nick. Or blind guy, I answer to that as well. :P ) 
- 👀 I’m interested in digital signal processing, cooking, music production, and sharing what I know about all of those things with other people. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: All of the above, honestly. New to C++, JUCE, ASPIK, and a snudge of Delphi as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Right now, I'm in a learning mode, but if anyone has any constructive suggestions, optimisations, or needs help testing some audio related code, let me know. I'll see what I can do. :) 
- 📫 How to reach me: If Github doesn't have any way to contact me, I'll set something up. Might take a bit.
